Activity Stream Description Language (ASDL) 0.1
===============================================

The *Activity Stream Description Language (ASDL)* is used for describing Activity Streams (AS) vocabularies.

ASDL is based on [AS 1.0](http://activitystrea.ms/) and its model of activities that make statements about actors (who is acting), verbs (what is the action), objects (what is the object of the action), and targets (what is the target of the action). The [AS 1.0 Base Schema](https://github.com/activitystreams/activity-schema/blob/master/activity-schema.md) defines an initial set of verbs, object types, and object properties.

Applications are free to invent their own concepts for verbs, object types, and object properties, but AS does not make any assumptions about how those should be described (The AS 1.0 Base Schema uses simple tables and textual descriptions with examples).
