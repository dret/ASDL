Activity Stream Documentation Language (ASDL)
=============================================

The *Activity Stream Documentation Language (ASDL)* is an attempt at making *Activity Streams (AS)* more self-describing. It's work in progress, with the current version being targeted at [AS 1.0](http://activitystrea.ms/) rather than the in-flux work on AS 2.0 at the [W3C Social Web WG](http://www.w3.org/Social/WG).

AS are great at sharing information about activities across applications and services. As long as AS use the built-in vocabulary, consensus is established through the way how this vocabulary is defined. [AS 1.0](https://github.com/activitystreams/activity-schema/blob/master/activity-schema.md) and [AS 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) have definitions for their core vocabularies. (The current version of AS 2.0 confusingly calls the actual core vocabulary the "[extended vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-activitystreams-vocabulary-20150129/#extendedtypes)", but hopefully this terminology will be cleaned up in future versions.)

ASDL is work in progress, currently the following resources are available:
