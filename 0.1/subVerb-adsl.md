# subVerb Property

The subVerb property allows the specialization of verbs, without requiring consumers to understand the specific flavor of specialization. The main verb should be one from the standard vocabulary, and then subVerb allows more nuanced meanings of this verb. The main issue is that the activity should still be meaningful when somebody without knowledge of the specific subVerb encounters it.
